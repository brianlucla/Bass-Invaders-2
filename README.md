Bass Invaders is an application that allows users utilize the power of AI to generate a playlist. Sometimes we get stuck in a funk and need a pump up song to pull us out, sometimes we need something meditative after a long day of stressful debugging. We created Bass Invaders to alleviate the stress and time it takes to find that perfect tune - just leave that in our hands.

Our simple and easy-to-use interface promotes an energizing musical adventure for techies of all levels - simply tell Bass Invaders what you are looking for, and we will return the perfect playlist designed specifically for you.
